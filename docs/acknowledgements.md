During the development process of this project I have used and consulted many resources, which are listed below.

### Website

* [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) - for swift website creation
* [Bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) - for site styling
* [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) - for great base for website style (Darkly)
* [Icons8](https://icons8.com) - purchased project logo
* [roundedhexagon@gmail.com](mailto:roundedhexagon@gmail.com) - for free low-poly texture, used in home page background

### Code Library

* [Project Orleans](http://dotnet.github.io/orleans) - used as a base for building whole project

I want to thank each and every author for their work, because without it, this project could not exists.
